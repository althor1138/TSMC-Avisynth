# TSMC-Avisynth
Motion Compensated Temporalsoften

function TSMC(clip input, int "tradius", int "mthresh", int "lumathresh", int "blocksize",clip "auxclip")

tradius

Temporal Radius.
The number of frames analyzed before and after the current frame.


mthresh

Motion Threshold.
The cutoff point for denoising. Anything above this threshold does not get denoised.


lumathresh

Luma Threshold.
Analyses surrounding temporal pixels.
If they fall within the threshold, they are used for denoising the current pixel.
If not, they are not used.
The values are always autoscaled to 8 bit. 
You can always use a value between 0-255 regardless of clip bit depth more or less.


blocksize

Block Size.
Determines how large the blocks generated by MVTOOLS should be.
Must be 4,8,16,32, or 64


auclip

Auxiliary Clip.
Option to feed MVTOOLS an already denoised clip for generating motion vectors.
